# VideoMouseTrackingSoftware
* quick GUI to track mouse movement as uploaded video plays

* made for Jeffiot

# Main structure:
.exe, open
	- browse (import video)

	- set frame rate and resolution
	- slider to zoom in on video, i.e., how much of it takes up the software window, and set that starting position.

	- press record (with shortcut to start and stop) and mouse moves camera around in 2D plane, scroll zooms in further or out.
	- playback button to show your recorded motion
	- settings button with two sliders to amend recorded video by adding extra random shakeiness to the video (similar to shaky handheldcam).

	- export button (exports movements as keyframes [json file])

extra idea:
	- mouse sensitivity settings
